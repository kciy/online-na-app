# Online NA Web App

This is the source code for the [ESN Germany website](onair2020.esn-germany.de) dedicated to online national assemblies.

## Content

The website provides information about deadlines, the chairing team, social media channels, links, candidates and important documents. A live agenda is implemented on the live-page and the voting results are available on the voting-page directly loaded via LimeSurvey.


## Development

Clone the repository to your local folder and navigate to the root folder. For changes, make a pull request or contact the IT Team.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build before Deployment

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Deploy

After authentication on firebase, run `firebase deploy` to create a new release of the site.
